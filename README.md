# Hill_RTS-s_immune_development_code

Supporting code for Hill et al. "Immune system development varies according to age, location and anemia in African children"


## Introduction

This code supports the manuscript. In particular, it outlines our methodology behind various figures in the paper.

This is a github mirror of an RStudio project. R libraries are managed by the packrat library manager, so it should be possible for the end-user to install on their local machine on a 'fresh' version of R.

The relevant data is supplied in the folder /data

## Workflow

1. Install RStudio

2. Install git, either via:
- https://git-scm.com
- or, if you do not have administrator rights, via conda

3. Follow RStudio's guide to pull a project from GitHub

4. Execute code in accompanying Rmd
